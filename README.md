Gameplay Flow

Core Mechanics
Players spend Bayanihan Spirit (recharged each round) to play cards.
The community’s Resilience represents the collective health of the town.
If Resilience drops to zero, the game ends.
At the start of each round, players draw 1 card.

Card Types
1. Tulong Cards (Aid)
Defensive cards.
Increase Resilience or block incoming damage.

Example: Provide First Aid → heals a specific injury.

2. Aksyon Cards (Action)
Proactive cards.
Address immediate threats.

Example: Clear Debris → removes a Road Block status effect.

3. Kaalaman Cards (Knowledge)
Strategic cards.
Provide information or manipulate the flow of the game.

Example: Weather Forecast → reveals upcoming threats.

4. Gabay Cards (Guidance)
Powerful, high-cost cards.
Represent leadership and coordination.

Enable multi-card plays or temporary boosts.

Combat System
No direct combat.
The game is designed as a strategic puzzle:
Cards channel abilities through the Bayanihan Guardian.
Players mitigate threats to preserve Resilience.
The challenge lies in efficient resource and hand management as situations escalate.
Visual and Physics
Traditional physics are not a core mechanic due to the 2D card game format.
Focus is on clear visual feedback for card effects.

UI uses smooth animations consistent with the 2D art style.
